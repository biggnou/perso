chrono.sh
=========

During school, some courses where not THAT interesting.

I used to play a lot on travian. And I needed to launch strikes or defenses at precise timing.
This script is intended to run in the background and, after the given waiting time, pop an alert window.

It worked well and I remember good wars and raids... ah... travian, I miss you!
