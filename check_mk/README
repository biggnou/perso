My personnal adds to monitor pfsense with check_mk
--------------------------------------------------

Check MK is a great monitoring tool, but the freebsd part is lacking... bits.

Particularly for pfsense, which is FreeBSD based but is particular.

Here are some basic checks, that works, and gives vital info for such an appliance.

Will eventually make this a plugin instead of local checks.
