4 SCRIPTS
=========

Those scripts pre-date my usage of Git.

nsh.sh is intended to actually generate homogenous headers.
maj.sh is intended to update the 'Modification' header.
printode.sh is intended to generate a file that will contain the content of all files within a directory.
wtf.sh is inteded to read the "Description" header and prompt it on STDOUT.

They are school projects and not maintained, while I sometimes remember to user nsh.sh...
